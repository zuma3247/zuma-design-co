            <h2>Case Study: innov8 Living & i8 Hotels</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>The Client</h3>
                <p>
                    innov8 Living is a new co-living concept launching in Dubai, designed for young professionals
                    and digital nomads seeking community-focused living experiences. Their sister brand, i8 Hotels,
                    offers boutique hotel stays with the same modern, connected philosophy.

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    The client was entering Dubai's competitive hospitality market with a fresh concept: flexible,
                    stylish living spaces that blur the line between long-term residence and hotel stay. They needed
                    a cohesive brand identity that would appeal to millennials and Gen Z travelers while communicating
                    quality and innovation. The challenge was creating print materials that matched their modern,
                    tech-forward positioning.

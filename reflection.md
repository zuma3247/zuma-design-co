# Layout Reflection

For this project, I made intentional layout decisions to ensure a clean, professional, and readable experience across all pages by utilizing a central `body` wrapper with a `max-width` of 700px. I used Flexbox meaningfully in the primary navigation array (`nav ul`) to evenly space and align the navigation links horizontally using `justify-content: center` and `gap`, avoiding clunky floats. Additionally, Flexbox was employed powerfully within the `.project-grid` to align the case study feature cards side-by-side on desktop views. To handle small screens effectively, I added responsive adjustments via a media query (`@media screen and (max-width: 600px)`) that leverages Flexbox's `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction: column` properties to stack the navigation links and project cards vertically. This ensures the content structure remains legible and accessible without horizontal scrolling on mobile devices. One thing I would improve next is building out a more robust Grid layout for the footer or expanding the Flexbox usage to include a strictly standardized form layout for the contact page for better alignment of labels and inputs.
